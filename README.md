### Unique Selling Points
There are many space experiences and games out there.  What makes "Adrift through the debris" unique is its interesting approach towards story telling. Nothing is directly told to the player, you must explore and analyse the environement to form your own story. Instead  of being bombarded with information you find your self relaxing and taking in the views. Often subconciously making links between areas to form conclulsions on what must have happened. 

"Adrift through the debris"'s procedural content generation also aids in standing out against competition. The generation makes the experience feel fresh everytime it is launched, luring players into spending far too long taking in the sites.
